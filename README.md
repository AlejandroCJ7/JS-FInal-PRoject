 JS-FInal-PRoject

I originally loved playing chess but trying to write code to create my own game(chess) was very challenging so i decided to try to do something similar which was checkers. It was very difficult which explains my game not being able to function properly. I looked at youtube videos and the links that were given in canvas but trying to transfer that knowledge to a game was confusing. I do need to practice more using javascript and just do code alongs on youtube. The game is still not functional, youre not able to click on the red and black pieces and move them. I also wanted the "reds turn" and "blacks turn" to have a highlight to let the player know that its their turn but wasnt able to complete it.
